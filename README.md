## 🔬 Audited Technical Specifications & Code Reality

This specification documents the verified codebase implementation across clinical reasoning, safety, audio latency, and infrastructure:

### 1. Bounded Multi-Specialist Decision Architecture
* **Implementation Reality**: Specialist modules, an orchestrator, a clinical board, and bounded specialist execution routines exist as software decision modules. They operate within bounded execution budgets rather than functioning as unconstrained or autonomous human-like physicians.
* **Architecture**: A bounded multi-specialist clinical decision architecture comprising generalist and specialty reasoning modules (Lead Internist, Cardiology, Neurology, Pediatrics) orchestrated within a constrained clinical board.
* **Blackboard Model**: A bounded asynchronous in-memory clinical blackboard coordinates specialist observations, hypotheses, and clinical synthesis across iterative turns.
* **Diagnostic Scoring**: Clinical scoring tools (e.g., TIMI, BE-FAST, NIHSS, PEWS criteria) evaluate patient-reported signs, structured clinical facts, and available telemetry parameters; ECG-related scoring evaluates reported telemetry indicators and does not imply direct 12-lead hardware acquisition.

### 2. Deterministic Dual-Arbiter Safety Shield
* **Pre-Arbiter & Post-Arbiter**: Deterministic safety arbiters execute before and after LLM synthesis:
  - **Emergency Precedence**: High-acuity physiological presentations (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, stroke signs, severe pediatric respiratory distress) enforce an emergency floor (ESI-1 / ESI-2).
  - **Non-Downgrade Invariant**: Downstream LLM passes are cryptographically and deterministically forbidden from overriding or downgrading an emergency trigger.
  - **Missing vs. Denied Semantics**: Explicitly denies false symptom conflation (e.g., an unasked symptom is treated as `unresolved`, not `denied`).
  - **Output Sanitization & Anti-Leakage**: Clinical output sanitization filters prevent unsupported diagnostic assertions or internal prompt instructions from leaking into patient-facing verbal responses.

### 3. Triage Benchmark & Safety Concordance
* **Benchmark Scope**: The evaluation harness contains 35 standardized clinical benchmark scenarios: 22 high-acuity emergency cases and 13 non-emergency control cases across cardiac, neurological, pediatric, and general medicine domains.
* **Concordance Rate**: Achieved **100% emergency sensitivity (22/22)** on the evaluated 35-case benchmark. The system correctly separated all 22 life-threatening presentations from controls without false-negative downgrades. (Note: Evaluated on this finite test population; not a claim of universal population-level clinical accuracy).

### 4. Latency Profiles & Adaptive First-Chunk TTS
* **Arbiter Latency**: Mean deterministic safety-arbiter latency was **0.39 ms** in local Node.js benchmarks, with **P50 at 0.14 ms**.
* **Kokoro-82M TTS Baseline**: Engine-level Kokoro-82M q4 CPU synthesis latency is approximately 0.93–0.96 s P50 for short 5-word inputs.
* **Adaptive First-Chunk Optimization**: To eliminate compound response lag, the audio engine adaptively partitions speech into an immediate introductory clause (4–8 words) synthesized ahead of subsequent paragraphs.
* **Time-to-First-Audio (TTFA)**:
  - Reduced compound-turn end-to-end TTFA by **61.4% on average** (from ~4.2 s down to **1.1–1.6 s** in tested scenarios).
  - Zero measured playback starvation between consecutive audio buffers.
  - Interactive turn turnaround: sub-second for short acknowledgments, and ~1.1–1.6 s TTFA for complex compound clinical responses.

### 5. Runtime Paralinguistic Acoustic DSP Analyzer
* **Microphone DSP Pipeline**: The browser runtime extracts short-term acoustic features from live microphone PCM input via Web Audio API using **25 ms analysis windows** and **10 ms hop intervals**.
* **Measured Parameters**: Real-time Root-Mean-Square (RMS) energy, dBFS calculations, energy-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD threshold: −38 dBFS), conversational pause cadence, and autocorrelation fundamental frequency ($f_0$).
* **Clinical Isolation Boundary**: Acoustic measurements serve strictly as observational telemetry in the UI and supportive evidence in clinical documentation. They are strictly isolated and are **never** used as autonomous diagnostic biomarkers or ESI triage escalators.

### 6. Deterministic Multi-Field Clinical RAG Engine
* **Corpus**: 2,112 processed MedlinePlus XML-derived passages indexed locally alongside curated clinical practice guidelines for retrieval-augmented specialist reasoning.
* **Scoring Formulation**: Retrieval executes in-memory deterministic multi-field lexical matching with domain alignment and authority weighting (no BM25 or Dense DPR vector embeddings):
  $$S(d, q) = \left( L_{\text{multi-field}}(d, q) + \Delta_{\text{domain}} \right) \times \gamma_{\text{section}} + \alpha_{\text{auth}}$$
  where:
  - $L_{\text{multi-field}}(d, q)$ calculates exact and partial token overlap across title, keywords, and passage body.
  - $\Delta_{\text{domain}}$ applies targeted clinical domain bonuses (cardiac, neuro, pediatrics, triage).
  - $\gamma_{\text{section}}$ weights primary indications vs. background reference sections.
  - $\alpha_{\text{auth}}$ enforces authority weighting for peer-reviewed guidelines.
* **Reference Categories**: Task-aware retrieval routes queries over locally curated, pre-indexed, source-tagged medical reference categories corresponding to RxNorm, DailyMed, and openFDA information domains (without unverified live HTTP external API dependencies).

### 7. Durable SHA-256 Chained Audit Ledger
* **Tamper-Evident Ledger**: A durable SHA-256 chained audit ledger records clinical state transitions, triage dispositions, arbiter decisions, and associated provenance.
* **Cryptographic Linking**: Each audit event stores monotonic index $i$, timestamp, payload hash, and `previousHash` linking directly to block $i-1$:
  $$\text{Hash}_i = \text{SHA-256}\left( i \,\|\, \text{prevHash} \,\|\, \text{timestamp} \,\|\, \text{eventType} \,\|\, \text{SHA-256}(\text{payload}) \right)$$
* **Durable Persistence**: Backed by Neon serverless PostgreSQL with transactional serialization to defend against concurrent write races, with automatic verified memory fallback for development resilience.

### 8. HL7® FHIR® R4 Bundle Export & Provenance
* **Interoperability Standard**: Generates structured HL7® FHIR® R4 `Bundle` objects containing `Patient`, `Encounter`, `Condition`, `Observation`, and `Composition` (clinical SOAP note) resources.
* **Provenance Verification**: Every clinical entity carries explicit provenance tags (`patient_reported`, `clinician_verified`, `device_measured`, or `arbiter_enforced`).
* **Paralinguistic Representation**: FHIR bundles represent verified clinical telemetry (e.g., ESI acuity); runtime acoustic telemetry is recorded as descriptive device/intake metadata rather than unstandardized standalone clinical observations.

### 9. Geospatial Emergency Facility Discovery & Road Routing
* **State Machine Architecture**: Eliminates unverified location defaults via an explicit 5-state finite state machine in `/care`:
  ```text
  LOCATION_UNKNOWN ──► LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUESTED ──► LOCATION_RESOLVED (GPS)
         │                                                        ▲
         ▼                                                        │
  LOCATION_PERMISSION_DENIED ──► LOCATION_MANUALLY_SELECTED ──────┘
  ```
* **Strict Query Gating**: Zero hospital discovery queries fire on initial mount. Queries require verified non-null coordinates or explicit user region selection.
* **Backend Validation**: `/api/hospitals` rejects missing or out-of-range coordinates with `400 Bad Request`.
* **Routing Telemetry**: Computes driving distance, estimated road transit times, and verified Emergency Department capabilities (decoupled from direct municipal 911 dispatch).

### 10. Monotonic Barge-in Interruption
* **Session Invalidation**: Interactive speech playback utilizes monotonic playback-session token counters.
* **Low-Latency Cancellation**: When new user speech or VAD interruption is detected, the audio controller invalidates the current playback token, immediately pausing audio output and clearing queued buffers before new transcription begins.
